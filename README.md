üçΩÔ∏è Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis Project

 Project Description

Zomato Data Analysis is one of the most useful analyses for food lovers who want to taste the best cuisines of every part of the world within their budget.
This project helps users identify:

    Best value-for-money restaurants across different countries.

    Most popular cuisines around the world.

    Which countries have the maximum number of restaurants listed.

    Trends like online delivery availability, price range patterns, etc.

Additionally, the project also helps understand the relationship between restaurant features (price range, ratings, votes) and the average cost for two people using Machine Learning.
 Technologies Used

    Python

    Pandas, NumPy

    Matplotlib, Seaborn

    Scikit-learn

    Jupyter Notebook

Project Workflow

    Data Cleaning

        Merging two datasets: Zomato and Country Code.

        Handling missing values and duplicates.

        Converting all restaurant costs to INR for uniformity.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

        Top 10 countries by restaurant count.

        Online delivery availability analysis.

        Most popular cuisines.

        Cost distribution visualization.

    Machine Learning Model

        Built a Linear Regression model to predict "Average Cost for Two."

        Model trained on features like Price Range, Aggregate Rating, and Votes.

        Evaluated using R¬≤ Score and RMSE.

    Data Export

        Cleaned data exported for further visualization (e.g., Power BI dashboard).

Key Findings

    India has the highest number of restaurants listed on Zomato.

    Online delivery is mostly available in India and UAE.

    North Indian cuisine is among the most popular.

    Strong correlation between ratings, votes, and average cost.
